# glowing-hero-section

Create a hero section for a portfolio website. The right column features an image of a generated man with short, neatly styled hair, looking directly at the camera with a neutral expression. The background includes a blue gradient with circular design elements and soft glowing lights. The left column has a welcome text with the title 'Welcome to my portfolio website', followed by a paragraph of Lorem Ipsum text, using Open Sans font and 10px size with little space between words. Below the paragraph, there are two buttons: 'Hire me' and 'Contact me', both with a border radius of 50px, orange background, and white text.
